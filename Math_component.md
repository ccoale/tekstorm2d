# Introduction #
The Math component, as you may have guessed, contains mathematical classes that help both the engine and the user of the engine build their game. The source to the math component can be found in the [tekstorm2d/math directory](http://code.google.com/p/tekstorm2d/source/browse/trunk/math).
