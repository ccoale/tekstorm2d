= Planned and Completed Features =
Below is a table of planned and completed features. If a feature is listed as being completed, it does not necessarily mean that we are done adding to that feature -- it simply means that the feature is already usable in its most basic form.

|| Vector3 || A class that represents a 3-dimensional vector. || Yes ||
|| Vector4 || A class that represents a 4-dimensional vector. || Yes ||
|| Matrix3 || A class that represents a 3x3 matrix. || No ||
|| Matrix4 || A class that represents a 4x4 matrix. || No ||
|| Color3 || A class that represents a 3-component color (Red, Green, Blue) || Yes ||
