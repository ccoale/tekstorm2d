= Introduction =
The Math component, as you may have guessed, contains mathematical classes that help both the engine and the user of the engine build their game. The source to the math component can be found in the [http://code.google.com/p/tekstorm2d/source/browse/trunk/math tekstorm2d/math directory].

= Planned and Completed Features =
Below is a table of planned and completed features. If a feature is listed as being completed, it does not necessarily mean that we are done adding to that feature -- it simply means that the feature is already usable in its most basic form.
