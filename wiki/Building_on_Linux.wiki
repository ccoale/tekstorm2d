= Introduction =

Tekstorm2D is a cross-platform game engine, and as such, it has build scripts for multiple platforms. This article will explain how to obtain the source code (the easy way) and then build it *on Linux*. This has been tested and confirmed to work on Ubuntu 11.04.


= Requirements =

* svn client
* g++ and make
* opengl libraries (gl, glu, glaux, freeglut)

= Grabbing the source =
First, before we can compile, we obviously have to grab the source. This can be done with SVN.

{{{
svn checkout http://tekstorm2d.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ tekstorm2d
}}}

This should now create a "tesktorm2d" directory that contains the tekstorm2d source. Now we can build it.

= Building =
{{{
cd tekstorm2d
make
}}}

That's it! It should now create a so and a link library in the ./bin directory.

The tekstorm2d makefile also contains targets for building only core components:
{{{
make net
make scripting
make math
make graphics
make audio
etc..
}}}
