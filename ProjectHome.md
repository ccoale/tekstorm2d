# Tekstorm Game Engine #
**Tekstorm2D** (often times just called Tekstorm) is a fast, efficient, and powerful Windows-platform 2D game engine. It is currently in development and is not even in the alpha phase at the moment. Please check back at a later time!

# Why use Tekstorm? #
It is difficult to find a 2D game engine that is both easy-to-use and powerful. Tekstorm is a fully-featured game engine that supports scripting, scene management, physics, audio, and more. What else? The source and engine API are clean -- that is, all of the code follows the **same** coding conventions, and we are striving to document nearly every line of source code (both in the headers and the source files)! This makes it easier for the user of the engine to find exactly what they want so they can easily make changes.

# Features #
We have been, and still are, working tirelessly to implement many features that will make Tekstorm an easy-to-use and powerful game engine. Below is the list of core components that make up the game engine, as well as their progress. You may follow the links in the table to view that specific feature's Wiki page -- it contains information about what is included in that feature, and the progress of each individual feature.
